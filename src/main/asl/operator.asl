The operator is going to be responsible for being the central point of communication for our agents.
A few things that the operator should keep track of:
- Absolute position reference for every agent, and the ability to translate between two agents' point of reference.
- Maintaining the overall mental model of the map.
- Task Parsing and requirement assignments.
